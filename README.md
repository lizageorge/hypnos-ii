# Hypnos 

A website that allows you to keep track of your sleep, simply. 

  

This repository will keep track of my progress in my second try at this project, and what I learn along the way. 

  

### **GOAL:**  

The purpose of this project is twofold. The first is to build a very simple website that can be used as a sleep tracker, which is legitimately just something I need to help get my sleep schedule back under control. The second purpose of the project is to act as a way for me to learn new web development tools and techniques. I’ll start by making the website using vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML (a basic front-end-only façade). Once I finish that version, I will recreate the project using a new tool or framework that I'm learning, and then repeat this process adding additional functionality along the way. 

### **TIMELINE:** 

*subject to change, I’ll update this README as necessary. I start a different coding bootcamp in July and college in August, so a lot of this schedule is up in the air depending on how much free time I get. 

 

6/14/21 - 6/15/21: vanilla JS/HTML/CSS 

6/17/21 - 6/21/21: remake using a styling front-end framework (Bootstrap?) 

6/23/21 - 6/20/21: remake using a front-end framework (React?) 

7/??/21 - 7/??/21: add backend functionality/connect to a database (using AWS?)
